## Rock Paper Scissors 
The Bing Bang edition

A simple demonstration of a game loop in python.

## Purpose
The purpose of this code is to demonstate the seperation of concern at both a class and functional level, following the single responsibilty principle.
the main game logic is maintained in a class in its own module, and each function only has a single purpose. 

All is tied together in the 'main' game loop.
